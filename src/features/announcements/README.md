# Announcements Feature

## Overview
The announcements feature provides a way to display and interact with announcements in the Learnest application. It includes a list view of announcements and a detailed view with comments functionality.

## Component Structure

The feature is built using a modular component architecture for better maintainability and performance:

### Core Components
- `AnnouncementDetail.tsx` - Main container component for announcement details
- `components/`
  - `announcement-card.tsx` - Displays individual announcement previews in lists
  - `Announcement-detail-card.tsx` - Detailed view of a single announcement
  - `AnnouncementHeader.tsx` - Header with navigation and action buttons
  - `CommentForm.tsx` - Form for adding new comments
  - `CommentItem.tsx` - Renders a single comment
  - `CommentsList.tsx` - Manages and displays the list of comments
  - `StatusAnimation.tsx` - Handles animations for read/bookmark status
- `types.ts` - Centralized type definitions

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Component Splitting
Components are split to load only what's needed:
- Separate components for list and detail views
- Lazy loading of non-critical components

### 2. Lazy Loading with Suspense
Components are loaded on-demand using React's lazy loading:
```tsx
const AnnouncementCard = lazy(() => import("./components/announcement-card"));
const AnnouncementDetail = lazy(() => import("./components/announcement-detail"));
```

### 3. Skeleton Loading States
Skeleton loaders are shown during content loading for better UX:
```tsx
<Suspense fallback={<CardSkeleton />}>
  <AnnouncementCard {...props} />
</Suspense>
```

### 4. View Transitions
The feature uses the View Transitions API for smooth animations between states.

## Type Safety

The `types.ts` file defines all necessary interfaces:

```typescript
interface Announcement {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  author: string;
  avatar?: string;
  content: string;
  date: string;
  time: string;
  isRead?: boolean;
  isBookmarked?: boolean;
  comments: Comment[];
}

interface Comment {
  id: string;
  author: string;
  avatar?: string;
  content: string;
  date: string;
  time: string;
}
```

## Usage

### Displaying an Announcement List
```tsx
import { AnnouncementCard } from '~/features/announcements';

function AnnouncementList({ announcements }) {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      {announcements.map(announcement => (
        <AnnouncementCard key={announcement.id} {...announcement} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Showing Announcement Details
```tsx
import { AnnouncementDetail } from '~/features/announcements';

function AnnouncementPage({ announcement }) {
  return (
    <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto">
      <AnnouncementDetail announcement={announcement} onBack={() => router.back()} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Component Composition**
   - Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
   - Use composition to build complex UIs from simple components

2. **Performance**
   - Use `React.memo` for expensive components
   - Implement proper loading and error states
   - Optimize images and other assets

3. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure proper ARIA attributes
   - Implement keyboard navigation
   - Support screen readers

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Implement server-side rendering for better initial load performance
- [ ] Add data caching with Tanstack Query
- [ ] Implement infinite scrolling for large announcement lists
- [ ] Add support for rich text content in announcements
- [ ] Implement real-time updates for new comments
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests
