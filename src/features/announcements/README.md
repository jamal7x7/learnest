# Announcements Feature Optimization

## Problem
The initial load of the announcements feature was very slow, as shown in the Chrome network dev tools. Multiple JavaScript chunks were being loaded sequentially with long load times (around 550-585ms each), causing poor user experience.

## Solution
The following optimizations were implemented to improve performance:

### 1. Component Splitting
The monolithic announcements component was split into smaller, focused components:
- `announcement-card.tsx`: Handles the display of individual announcement cards
- `announcement-detail.tsx`: Manages the detail view and comment functionality
- `types.ts`: Centralizes type definitions and dummy data

### 2. Lazy Loading
Implemented React's lazy loading with Suspense to defer loading components until they're needed:
```tsx
const AnnouncementCard = lazy(() => import("./components/announcement-card"));
const AnnouncementDetail = lazy(() => import("./components/announcement-detail"));
```

### 3. Loading Skeletons
Added skeleton loaders to improve perceived performance while components are loading:
```tsx
<Suspense fallback={<CardSkeleton />}>
  {/* Component content */}
</Suspense>
```

### 4. Preloading Strategy
Created a preload utility (`preload.ts`) that can be used to preload components when a user hovers over links to the announcements page, further reducing perceived loading time.

## How to Use

### Preloading
To enable preloading of announcement components when users hover over links:

```tsx
import { attachAnnouncementPreload } from '~/features/announcements/preload';

// Call this in your app initialization
attachAnnouncementPreload();
```

## Benefits

- **Reduced Initial Load Time**: Only essential code is loaded initially
- **Improved User Experience**: Skeleton loaders provide visual feedback during loading
- **Better Code Organization**: Modular components are easier to maintain
- **Optimized Bundle Size**: Code splitting reduces the size of each chunk

## Further Improvements

- Consider implementing server-side rendering for the initial view
- Add data caching with Tanstack Query for API-based announcements
- Implement image optimization for avatar images
- Add pagination for large announcement lists
